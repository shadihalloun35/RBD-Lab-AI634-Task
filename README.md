# RBD-Lab-AI634-Task
 
## Descrpition
The task is to track the "fork carts" using cameras that are mounted on the ceiling and are facing downwards. The carts can rotate and move on the ground plane. Because of this setup, we essentially have a 2D problem, and the task is to estimate a 2D translation (x, y coordinates) and a 2D rotation (a single angle) of the cart.
